It's an honour to have played part in securing an internal Masaryk University grant for innovation of teaching key subjects. 
In the following year my supervisor, Jan Koláček, and I will be innovating a core subject *Mathematical software*, in order to improve R and MATLAB programming skills of our students.
Very excited to be a part of this project!
